The screen is made out of a 80 x 21 grid of Cell structs. Each Cell has two properties: Type and Hardness.
Type is what character type fills the spot (ie '.', '<', '>', '-', '|', or ' '). Hardness is the hardness of the
Cell: 255 for '|' and '-' for immutable, 254-1 random hardness for rock (' '), 0 for room elements ('.', '<', '>')  

First is initialization which sets the border to '-'s and '|' and hardness 255. Then fills the rest with rock all
with random hardness.

Second is initializing the rooms. Getting a random coordinate in the grid try and fit a random sized room with the 
random coordinate as a pivot point if first configuration fails. If a valid location is found insert the room and 
update hardness. All room placement follows this strategy. After getting a valid 2nd room a corridor function is called
to connect two random points in the newly created room and the previously created room. The linking is done by creating
a horizontal line from the x-point of the new room to the same x coordinate of the previous room then drawing a vertical
line to the y coordinate of the new room. If room 5 is being generated and no stair down has been created room 5 will have
a stair down in a random location within the room. Room 6 has a similiar property except being for stair up.

Room Specs
Number of rooms: 7-10
Size: Horizontal 5 - 12 Cells x Vertical 6 - 9 Cells
Randomly occuring Stair occur about 1/250 of all room cells
Each generation is guarenteed at least 1 stair up and 1 stair down

How to run: run "make" then run "./dungeon"
