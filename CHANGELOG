1/30: Have screen bounds working. Added feature of 6+ generating rooms all seperated within
    all the valid area. Started on linking rooms using corridors, currently doesn't work, 
    likely an error in pathing generation of corridors

2/1: Completed Corridor mapping where a random point from two rooms is selected to be linked
    with the previously created room. Current bug of always 6 rooms being generated

2/2: Fixed issue of only 6 rooms being added now it range from 7-10 rooms. Started and implemented
    hardness switching to using a 2d array of "Cells" instead of chars. Cells hold a char and a 
    hardness integer. Updated all methods that were using the old char grid. Not a bug but I want 
    to change my corridor generating method to look nicer possibly adding non straight lines 

2/3: Modified the Corridor mapping to start by going horizontal then to vertical rather than
    vertical to horizontal. Along with updating rooms to generate taller making the visual 
    appear less chaotic. Also created Makefile

2/4: Moved all of the generation into its own file and header for organization. Submitted

2/5: Added possibability of stairs being located into corridors, also added error for when
    a valid room configuration is not possible. Resubmitted
