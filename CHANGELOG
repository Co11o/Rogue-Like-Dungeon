2/26: Created Character Map struct which is an array of char's the width of the screen and an array of characters. Created initialization
    function for monsters and character map

2/27: Completed movement for Intelligent and Telepathic monster (Tunneling and Non-Tunneling). Also created Eratic movement. Tested both

2/28: Created and tested Line of sight function, finish all Intelligent monsters

3/1: Created and tested all Non Intelligent monster movements. Began on character priority queue.

3/2: Continued work on movement queue. Still need to work on removing node for a monster that dies and handling dead monsters

3/3: Fixed issue with dead monsters still being in queue. Finished code in main for movement.

3/4: Commented out all non essential print statements. Debugging and got one seg fault error while not running in debug mode, haven't been able to replicate. Either I fixed the issue when cleaning up code or
    updating. Also possible a bug exists somewhere. If a bug exists it's very small since in 2 days of through testing the error only popped up twice in a couple 
    hundred excutions. Only go errors when running not in gdb

3/4: (Part 2) segfault caused by when a character kills another character and the list of characters is full. Previous was searching through list to find first invalid array item, but if the list is full of valid
    entries the search would go past the bounds. Also updated main to use malloc's/free's for new priority queue and character_map. Submitted
