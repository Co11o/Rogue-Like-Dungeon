2/8: Changed structs previously only had a Cell's which had hardness and character type.
    Now have room struct containing top right corner X coordinate and Y coordinate then 
    width and height of the room. Cell's still remains. Another new struct Stair has a 
    stair location x and y then direction 1 means stair going up and -1 is stair going down
    other values are an error. Finally a struct'Dungeon' is made up of [80][21] array Cell's 
    representing the screen, Array of Rooms in the dungeon, room count of total rooms. Integers
    for location of PC X and Y coordinates, Integers for total stair cases up and stair cases down.
    Array of all stairs structs in the dungeon. Just for simplicity corridor mapping is now done 
    through connecting the middle of each room to the previous. Might go back to random x and y 
    connections of rooms. Generation works with new structs

2/9: Created new load and save features. Both are untested functions and still need to be implemented 
    into main. Also need to add implement getting file path and getting file that needs to be read
    
2/11: Added code that allows main to get the file path /.rlg327/dungeon. Tested load and save funtions
    both failed and needed to change struct properties from ints to uint's of the correct sizes. Fixed
    bug where load and save overwriting PC character with stairs or room character. Base test 1-10 work
    along with --save then calling --load but adventure, hello, and well_done dungeons have seg faults.

2/12: Fixed seg faults by fixing an error where a max number of rooms or stairs caused misalligned reads
    leading to seg faults. No known bugs. Submitted
